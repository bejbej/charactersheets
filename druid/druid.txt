Member of a roaming tribe of loxodon called Parade Rainmaker.
The tribe roams between villages in the savannah to water the crops.
Fire and lightning magic is taboo on the arid savannah as the practice could easily spark destructive wildfires.
Is a big proponent for non-mmo plants. Plants should not be magically induced to grow. A natural grown plant is more tasty and healthier too.

Was separated from parents during a dust storm when he was young. He was later found and adopted by the Rainmaker parade.


Parents - Unknown
No siblings.


Tasked by Maru to investigate happenings. (What kind of happenings? Crop specific happenings?)
Received a postcard from a place called Bed, Bat, & Beyond with the words "Wish you were here.".
Traveled to BBB.
