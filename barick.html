                                    by magic of any sort, its short-term needs (such as food or safety), and actions you
                                    can take (if any) to persuade it to not attack. You cannot use this ability against a

                                    are present within 5 miles of you. This feature reveals which of your favored enemies
                                    are present, their numbers, and the creatures’ general direction and distance (in miles)
                                    from you. If there are multiple groups of your favored enemies within range, you learn
                                    this information for each group.
                                </li>
