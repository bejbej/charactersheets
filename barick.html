                            <h3>Darkvision</h3>

                            <p>Accustomed to life underground, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can
                                see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if
                                it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>

                            <h3>Dwarven Resilience</h3>

                            <p>You have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Fighting Style: Dueling</h3>

                            <p>When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to
                                damage rolls with that weapon.</p>

                            <h3>Fighting Style: Defense</h3>

                            <p>While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.</p>

                            <h3>Second Wind</h3>

                            <p>You have a limited well of stamina that you can draw on to protect yourself from harm. On your
                                turn, you can use a bonus action to regain hit points equal to 1d10 + your fighter level.
                                Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or long rest before you can use it again.</p>

                            <h3>Action Surge</h3>

                            <p>You can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On your
                                turn, you can take one additional action on top of your regular action and a possible bonus
                                action.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Extra Attack</h3>

                            <p>You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action
                                on your turn.</p>

                            <h3>Piercing Thorns</h3>
                            
                            <p>Your command of primal magic allows you to enhance your attacks with thorns. Once during each of your turns,
                                you can deal an additional 1d6 piercing damage to one creature you hit with a weapon attack.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Hoofprints of the Ram</h3>
                            
                            <p>One per day you may cast the Pass Without Trace spell.</p>

                            <h3>Favored Enemy: Beast & Dragon</h3>

                            <ul>
                                <li>You gain a +4 bonus to damage rolls with weapon attacks against beasts and dragons.</li>
                                <li>you have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track beasts and dragons, as well as on Intelligence checks
                                        to recall information about them.</li>
                                <li>You have advantage on saving throws against spells and abilities used by dragons.</li>
                            </ul>
                            
                            <h3>Natural Explorer</h3>

                            <ul>
                                <li>You ignore difficult terrain.</li>
                                <li>You have advantage on initiative rolls.</li>
                                <li>On your first turn during combat, you have advantage on attack rolls against creatures that
                                    have not yet acted.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Primal Awareness</h3>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Through sounds and gestures, you can communicate simple ideas to a beast as an action, and
                                    can read its basic mood and intent. You learn its emotional state, whether it is affected
                                    by magic of any sort, its short-term needs (such as food or safety), and actions you
                                    can take (if any) to persuade it to not attack. You cannot use this ability against a
                                    creature that you have attacked within the past 10 minutes.</li>
                                <li>You can attune your senses to determine if any of your favored enemies lurk nearby. By spending
                                    1 uninterrupted minute in concentration, you can sense whether any of your favored enemies
                                    are present within 5 miles of you. This feature reveals which of your favored enemies
                                    are present, their numbers, and the creatures’ general direction and distance (in miles)
                                    from you. If there are multiple groups of your favored enemies within range, you learn
                                    this information for each group.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Guardian Soul</h3>

                            <p>As a bonus action, you assume the appearance of a treelike person, covered
                                    with leaves and bark, which lasts until you end it as a bonus action
                                or until you are incapacitated.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Your size becomes Large.</li>
                                <li>Your speed is 5 feet.</li>
                                <li>Your reach increases by 5 feet.</li>
                                <li>You gain a number of temporary hit points at the start of each of your turns. The number equals half your ranger level.
                                    When the form ends, you lose any temporary hit points you have from it.</li>
