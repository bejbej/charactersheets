                        <h3>Maneuvering Attack</h3>
                        <p>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to maneuver one
                            of your comrades into a more advantageous position. You add the superiority die to the attack's
                            damage roll, and you choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That creature can use
                            its reaction to move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks from the target
                            of your attack.</p>

                        <h3>Disarming Attack</h3>
                        <p>When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to disarm
                            the target, forcing it to drop one item of your choice that it's holding. You add the superiority
                            die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed
                            save, it drops the object you choose. The object lands at its feet.</p>

                        <h3>Rally</h3>
                        <p>On your turn, you can use a bonus action and expend one superiority die to bolster the resolve of
                            one of your companions. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you. That
                            creature gains temporary hit points equal to the superiority die roll + your Charisma modifier.</p>

                        <p>You gain the ability to comprehend and verbally communicate with beasts for the duration. The knowledge
                            and awareness of many beasts is limited by their intelligence, but at minimum, beasts can give
                            you information about nearby locations and monsters, including whatever they can perceive or
                            have perceived within the past day. You might be able to persuade a beast to perform a small
                            favor for you, at the DM's discretion.</p>

                        <p>At Higher Levels: When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the healing
                            increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 1st.</p>

                        </ul>
                        <p>You choose a creature you can see within range and mystically mark it as your quarry. Until the spell
                            ends, you deal an extra 1d6 damage to the target whenever you hit it with a weapon attack, and
                            you have advantage on any Wisdom (Perception) or Wisdom (Survival) check you make to find it.
                            If the target drops to 0 hit points before this spell ends, you can use a bonus action on a subsequent
                            turn of yours to mark a new creature.
                        </p>
                        <p>At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd or 4th level, you can maintain
                            your concentration on the spell for up to 8 hours. When you use a spell slot of 5th level or
                            higher, you can maintain your concentration on the spell for up to 24 hours.</p>
